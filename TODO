- Template-ise vectors. Add vector operation methods

- Get window open

- Investigate colour stuff

- Look into metastruct crawling
       - Perhaps provide each struct with a static constexpr member
         that returns its size and parse changed structs (for this a
         dict of current structs will be needed)
